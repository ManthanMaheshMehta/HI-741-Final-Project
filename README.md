#  Clinical Data Warehouse - HI 741 Final Project
This project is a Clinical Data Warehouse system developed for HI 741 (Spring 2025) at UWM. It provides an interactive user interface (UI) built with Tkinter, allowing different types of users (admin, management, nurse, clinician) to log in, manage patient records, and generate key usage statistics.

The system simulates real-world hospital workflows such as:
- Adding, retrieving, and removing patient visit records
- Viewing clinical notes
- Counting visits on specific dates
- Generating descriptive summaries from patient data
